I am a master student at  [Robotics and Perception Group](https://rpg.ifi.uzh.ch/index.html) led by [Prof. Davide Scaramuzza](https://scholar.google.ch/citations?user=SC9wV2kAAAAJ&hl=en). I am interested in Computer Vision and Deep Learning with a focus on efficient inference and sparse computation. I did my master's thesis on accelerating Vision Transformer inference by dynamically pruning redundant tokens.
Prior to that, I received my bachelors degree in _Mathematics and Applied Mathematics_ from [University of Science and Technology of China (USTC)](https://en.ustc.edu.cn/).

I was lucky to did my master thesis on sparse computation for vision transformers at [Robotics and Perception Group]&#40;https://rpg.ifi.uzh.ch/index.html&#41; under the supervision of  [Prof. Davide Scaramuzza]&#40;https://scholar.google.ch/citations?user=SC9wV2kAAAAJ&hl=en&#41;. My interest lies in computer vision and deep learning, especially with efficient computation.)

Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page]&#40;/al-folio/publications/&#41; automatically.)
