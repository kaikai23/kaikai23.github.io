I am a Data Science master's student at  [University of Zurich (UZH)](https://www.uzh.ch/cmsssl/en.html). I was lucky to did my master thesis on sparse computation for vision transformers at [Robotics and Perception Group](https://rpg.ifi.uzh.ch/index.html) under the supervision of  [Prof. Davide Scaramuzza](https://scholar.google.ch/citations?user=SC9wV2kAAAAJ&hl=en). My interest lies in computer vision and deep learning, especially with efficient computation.
Prior to my master's study, I obtained my bachelor's degree in _Mathematics and Applied Mathematics_ from [University of Science and Technology of China (USTC)](https://en.ustc.edu.cn/).

Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page]&#40;/al-folio/publications/&#41; automatically.)
