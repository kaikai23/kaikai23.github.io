Hello World, I am a Research Assistant in [ETH AIT Lab](https://ait.ethz.ch/) led by [Prof. Otmar Hilliges](https://ait.ethz.ch/people/hilliges) with a current research focus on 3D human-object interaction reconstruction from a single in the wild image.

Before that, I did my master thesis at  [Robotics and Perception Group](https://rpg.ifi.uzh.ch/index.html) @ [University of Zurich](https://www.uzh.ch/cmsssl/en.html) led by [Prof. Davide Scaramuzza](https://scholar.google.ch/citations?user=SC9wV2kAAAAJ&hl=en) and worked on Computer Vision and Deep Learning with a focus on efficient inference and sparse computation, by means of pruning redundant tokens for Vision Transformers.

Even before, I obtained my BSc degree in Mathematics @ [University of Science and Technology of China](https://en.ustc.edu.cn/).

I was lucky to did my master thesis on sparse computation for vision transformers at [Robotics and Perception Group]&#40;https://rpg.ifi.uzh.ch/index.html&#41; under the supervision of  [Prof. Davide Scaramuzza]&#40;https://scholar.google.ch/citations?user=SC9wV2kAAAAJ&hl=en&#41;. My interest lies in computer vision and deep learning, especially with efficient computation.)

[comment]: <> (Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page]&#40;/al-folio/publications/&#41; automatically.)
