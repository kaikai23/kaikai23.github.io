    - title: Exploring Sparse Computation with Vision Transformers, 09/2022 - 03/2023
      items: 
        - Master's thesis at <a href="https://rpg.ifi.uzh.ch/index.html">RPG</a> with Mathias Gehrig, Nico Messikommer and <a href="https://scholar.google.ch/citations?user=SC9wV2kAAAAJ&hl=en">Prof. Davide Scaramuzza</a>
        - Grade 6.0/6.0
        - Mission - Exploring using the sparsity in the input images to process only the silient tokens in ViTs for improved inference efficiency without apparent loss in model accuracy, extending existing methods for classification to object detection and instance segmentation.

      items:
        - Semester's Course Project at <a href="https://cvg.ethz.ch/">CVG</a> supervised by Paul-Edouard Sarlin, <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=YYH0BjEAAAAJ&hl=en">Prof. Marc Pollefeys</a>
        - Grade 6.0/6.0
        - Mission - extend the pycolmap Python bindings to have more control over the reconstruction process, and build a Python SLAM system that is simple, fast, and robust.
    - title: Efficient Spatio-Temporal Processing of Event Data, 09/2021 - 02/2022
      items:
        - Master project at <a href="https://rpg.ifi.uzh.ch/index.html">RPG</a> with Mathias Gehrig, Nico Messikommer and <a href="https://scholar.google.ch/citations?user=SC9wV2kAAAAJ&hl=en">Prof. Davide Scaramuzza</a>
        - Grade 5.75/6.0
        - Mission - investigate the pros and cons of two potential methods for processing event camera data, voxel-based methods such as 2D or 3D CNNs, and point-based methods such as PointNet.
          Combine the the point-voxel methods to improve the performance on classification and optical flow regression.
    - title: Multi-task Learning and Detection for Autonomous Driving, 04/2021 - 07/2021
      items:
        - An <a href="https://competitions.codalab.org/competitions/31727#results">competition</a> in ETH course Deep Learning for Autonomous Driving
        - Win the 2nd place for Lidar points 3D Object Detection
        - Mission - Adopted DeepLabv3+ model and used multi-task learning (MTL) models to achieve semantic segmentation and monocular depth estimation jointly.
          Tried three architectures to achieve MTL, Joint architecture, Branched architecture, and architecture with self-attention modules.
          Built a 2-stage 3D object detector to detect vehicles in autonomous driving scenes.
